         <h1>Mando SMP</h1>
            <p>Mando SMP is a fun semi-anarchy realm which allows for griefing and pvp, meanwhile blocking hacks and other game-breaking exploits. We take use of a strong verification system as well as auto-mod (a service that blocks windows and android players) which helps prevent as many hackers as possible. We offer to whitelist players that have shown themselves as trustworthy.</p>
                <br>
            <p>We try to have weekly events to keep the server active and fun. We may add cities in the future that do not allow griefing or stealing.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Our main realm does not have cheats enabled. This means that you can get achievements on this realm. Our second realm is a dedicated pvp realm. You can join this realm with your friends to practice pvp whenever you would like.</p>
                <br>
            <p>If you are interested in joining Mando SMP, please join our discord server which you can find below.</p>
