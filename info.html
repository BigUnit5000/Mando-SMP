            <h2>Info</h2>
            <p><b>What is Mando SMP?</b></p>
            <p>Mando SMP is an active community realm with automod (this kicks pc and android players to protect against hackers) as well as chat relay which sends messages between our realm and discord server.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Do I need to meet any requirements to join?</b></p>
            <p>In order to join you must pass our verification process as we have multiple servers that target this realm. Our verification process is easy to pass if you are a legitimate player.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>How many realms are there?</b></p>
            <p>We currently have two realms. We have the main server (semi-anarchy) and we also have a pvp realm. If you are not in both of these realms, feel free to create a ticket in order to gain access.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>What are the perks of boosting the discord server?</b></p>
            <p>Boosting the discord server will give you access to special channels that normal members cannot access. You also can now run more RealmBot commands such as realm lastseen and realm recent. You also will be able to give yourself a custom nickname. In addition <b>you will be automatically whitelisted on the realm.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>><b>How do I join the realm?</b></p>
            <p>In order to join the realm, you will have to verify with both Realm Bot and Double Counter as well as complete a form. Once you have done that you will need to reach level 5 in our discord server with Mee6.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>How do I get whitelisted from automod?</b></p>
            <p>If you wish to join on all devices but are blocked by automod there are multiple steps you can take to be whitelisted. </p>
            <p>Firstly, you can boost our discord server and wait five days as this proves you will not likely hack as you invested in our server. </p>
            <p>Secondly, you can get a referral from a senior moderator or above. </p>
            <p>Thirdly, you can play on another device for a period of time until we can verify that you do not want to cause harm on the realm. </p>
            <p>Lastly, you can rank up to level 15 on our discord (via Mee6) as this proves you are unlikely to hack on our realm.</p>
